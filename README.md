Welcome!

This is the API portion of my Algofolio project. It is made in .NET using .NET 8

In order to use it, you will need to make sure that you have Microsoft SQL server and Microsoft SQL management studio installed.

In SQL management studio, make sure that the database you connect to has the following tables:
Stocks
Comments

You can setup your local Server name in the appsettings.json under "Default" > Data Source={YOUR SERVER}, currently the value is "."

You can add dummy data although you should be able to do everything through the API. Make sure to have stocks to add comments to.
